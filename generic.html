											<h3><a href="#"><strong><span style="color: rgba(66, 0, 128, 0.589);">Payments & Collection</span></strong></a></h3>
											<p>I was also involved in industry testing so basically I coordinated with BankServ (ACH) for US on them and Them on US scenario while dealing with other banks for payments and collection
												I was also leading a small compliance project which is CMA cross border Monetary area.
												We all know that NAMIBIA , SWAZILAND and LESOTHO uses the same currency so money laundering may happen for terrorism.
												It was basically a AML project where we patched a separate file which contained details of debtor and creditor so that legit transaction happens between the bank and legal action must be taken in case of fraudulent activity.
												Transaction passes through SAFEWATCH and SWIFT for AML check.If debtor and creditor both are legit then it goes to successful transaction.
